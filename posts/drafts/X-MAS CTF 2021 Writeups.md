# XMAS CTF 2021
This capture the flag competition was the first I ever competed in (in 2020), and contains some of the most creative and varied challenges I've seen thus far. I competed individually and had other commitments during the competition times, so I didn't invest as much time as I would have liked, however the experience was still quite entertaining and educational.
