<p>I am not a lawyer, this topic just interests me so I did some research and made a short index of a summary</p>
<h1 id="hippa">HIPPA</h1>
<h4 id="health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</h4>
<h3 id="intent">Intent:</h3>
<p>Health information</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>any information (including genetic information) that is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public health authority, employer, life insurance company, school or university, or health care clearinghouse and relates to:
- a person&#39;s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition;
- treatment provided to a person; or
- past, present, or future payment for healthcare an individual receives</code></pre>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="ftc-act">FTC Act</h1>
<h4 id="federal-trade-commission-act">Federal Trade Commission Act</h4>
<h3 id="intent-2">Intent:</h3>
<p>A catch-all act for anti-competitive behavior on the web and enforcement of privacy policies and claims.</p>
<h3 id="interesting-notes-2">Interesting Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FTC has the right to collect (by subpoena, or civil investigative demand, which allows for requirement of answers to questions as opposed to just provision of information) and investigate data of most businesses who deal in commerce</li>
<li>FTC can require a company to file reports concerning their conduct and connections, leaving the company subject to a penalty for each day of non-compliance 30 days after a federal court order</li>
<li>FTC can conduct (voluntary) studies on data they collect as they please, and may release their findings “for the public good”</li>
<li>Confidential information can be shared between government agencies</li>
<li>FTC must be notified of intent to participate in a merger (so that anticompetitive investigations may be conducted), given that the combined value of the companies will exceed 101 million</li>
<li>May request data for foreign companies</li>
<li>FTC protects against unfair or deceptive (likely to be the direct cause of <em>substantial</em> injury to consumers) acts in or affecting commerce [ie false marketing, violated privacy policies]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exceptions-2">Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cannot investigate banks, savings and loan institutions</li>
<li>Company can file a petition to limit/quash a subpoena, which draws out the court process (requires federal enforcement)</li>
<li>“Although parties are not obligated to comply with a second request, consummation of the transaction without complying is illegal.” Context: a request for merger information extending on the first</li>
<li>Deceptive activities are allowed if they are “outweighed by countervailing benefits”</li>
<li>Internet service providers and consumer reporting agencies are protected from liability for disclosure of information relating to fraud or deception</li>
<li>Court order may end up in: “the accused party to enter into a consent agreement with the FTC in which the party does not admit guilt but agrees never to engage in the questionable behaviour in the future”</li>
</ul>
