## Avoiding Burnout (as a student)
*- Advice I gave to a friend on how to avoid burnout -*

- Vary what you consider "productive". I go on chatrooms and dark web forums and have fun, and that's technically not work but still useful, meaning it doesn't contribute to burnout (because it's chill) but still helps in life. 

- Variety in general is useful - do interesting stuff that isn't infosec like ... hardware! or signals processing or psych or learn LISP or write an essay or whatever. 

- Also, just take breaks every once in a while. Take a day without access to a computer. You'll crave work again soon enough (and may end up doing better with a fresher perspective). 

- Another tip: keep track of what you do every day, and plan what you want to do the next day. Takes around 5-10 mins and really helps you see that you're making progress of some sort, and hence aids in avoiding feeling burntout (maybe. depends on the reason). 

- Overall, staying balanced is key. Your life should not be entirely consumed by work. You should certainly get things done, but also see people, release dopamine, build memories

- Also, keep in mind that even if you tone down the amount of work you do, you're still doing considerably better than average :)
