# An Archive of an About Me Page
I wrote this around half a year ago (on a previous blog) and the description is still valid. I do try to focus more on projects than learning now (so I'm starting to have more useful things on my github), and my appreciation for Linux, Python, and Rust continues to grow.

## About Me
My name is Unknown to you and I’m just trying to practice website making I see no point in spending an amount of time disproportionate to my results working on a website from scratch, so I used Hugo, and its awesome. webdev is overrated. simplicity is key.

I’ve been coding for around a year now, and have learned a few languages (in order):

- Python
    - most comfortable in this lang
    - tensorflow, opencv
    - personal projects
    - kaggle
- C
   - my first language
   - fun fine control for networking
   - sec stuff, overflows/reversing
- Rust
   - I have a strange propensity to this language, its awesome
   - rustacean
   - memory safe c++!
   - still learning
   - not nearly enough libraries yet, but its getting there
   - hopefully will become mainstream
   - the book is awesome
- Golang
   - the asynch stuff is really nice. kind of like Dart
   - so clean
- Bash
   - linux
   - automation scripts
   - want to show off and not use python even though it would be faster to write, if not native
- Java
   - generally useless, soon to be phased out, but good for learning algorithms
   - minecraft mods
   - why oh why does it run in a vm…
   - so many better alternatives - the language that everyone is trying to improve upon
- C#
   - overrated, microsoft’s java
- Assembly
   - x86_64 for a bootloader and for reversing
   - ARM for fun, an OS

I’m interested in Cybersecurity, networking, Linux/Unix systems, low-level programming (embedded, hardware), and general software development. I use Ubuntu and Arch

I have literally nothing useful on my github lol
