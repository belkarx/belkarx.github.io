<h1 id="wasted-time">Wasted Time</h1>
<p>For 12 years, 180 days a year, 6 hours a day, most students are required by external forces to sit in classrooms, shuffled around periodically, listening to endless lectures while sneaking glances at the clock. What do these 13,000 hours break down to? Nowhere near enough.</p>
<p>A common example: a student finishes their work before everyone else. The teacher tells them to sit in silence until the rest of the class finishes. No talking to others, lest you distract them or the people around you. No working on other things; that’s “off topic” and “disrespectful”. And of course, working ahead of the class is frowned upon. If that happens every day, every class, because the standard that <em>other</em> students are held to is considerably lower, imagine how much time anyone mildly ahead wastes.</p>
<p>This is slightly mitigated if teachers are more lenient and allow working ahead, but what happens when all the work for the day is complete? Students just lie down on their desks, listening to the scratching of pencils, occasional coughs, mechanical squeaks of chairs and desks as the micromovements of others’ work engulf their stagnant selves.</p>
<p>In some schools, even that is an extreme example. Teachers allow you to talk to others when you finish, or to work on homework for other classes. But that’s still not enough. A motivated student can complete all of their assigned work and homework for the day, and still have significant swathes of time remaining in which they cannot do anything productive. There is no alternative work provided. If you want to take a more advanced class, wait for a window to open where teachers allow you to test upwards, and even having that as an option is rare.</p>
<p>If you are above the average, the 50% mark, or even above the lowest, the weakest link, school time is not being utilized well by default. Being proactive and organizing your own time is heavily restricted over arbitrary beliefs that it is distracting or inconsiderate to the teacher’s plans.</p>
<p>The salient phrase in that statement is <strong>by default</strong>. Anyone with ambition can find a way to waste less time, be it unschooling or making arrangements with understanding teachers. But the rest are confined to working within the minimums, following instruction exactly with the rest of the herd, even if they can do more with their time.</p>
<p>Students need to be taught how to learn, how to pursue their interests and passions, and allowed to productively use the free time remaining after completing the school’s minimum. The new generation is underutilized and undereducated.</p>
